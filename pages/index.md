# Development Documentation

{% callout %}
Built with Markdoc, a full-featured boilerplate for a creating a documentation website using Markdoc and Next.js.  This was built very quickly and is in draft mode.  Forgive the typos and spelling errors for now.
{% /callout %}

## Getting Started

Read the [Overview](/docs) to get a grasp of this site.


### Project Path
Read the Project Path [Timeline](/docs/project-timeline) to review the work done to date.  It is in reverse chronological order, so start at the bottom your first time through.

Read about the individual projects in the Project Path section.  These projects will be fleshed out as necessary to support SRED claims and Enerpro's other needs.


### Current Focus
This will document what the developer is currently tasked with.  It also includes the current outstanding request developer may have.

### Next Steps
This is where we will document the near future work.

### Development Logs
To support SRED developer log requirements.


### Production
To help track and manage the services that will power Enerpro's IT.
