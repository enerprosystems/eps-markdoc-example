Hi,


Glad you liked it.  It is deceptively simple, but address failure points gracefully.

I encourage you add the web app to your iPhone' Home Screen for a quick test.  It only takes a moment and will help to give you a sense of the potential for our upcoming apps.

Open the appropriate link below in Safari on your phone

Click the share icon

Choose “Add to Home Screen”
Safari will minimize and you will see an Enerpro app icon on your phone.

You can now just open that Enerpro “App” to make payments.  The Customer Portal could be installed in the same way.
