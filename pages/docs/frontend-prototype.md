# Payment Portal Frontend Prototype

## Summary

Enerpro is preparing to implement an online client portal to allow their customers to view and pay bills online.  The first step is to clearly articulate the details of the deliverable.  We will build and refind a static front-end prototype to help document the exact requirements for the payment portal.


## Motivation

Defining a specific deliverable is necessary to provide a reliable price and timeline.  ioFusion will create a static prototype web application to provide a clear example of the customer experience; the prototype will include all data and user interface elements necessary to support online viewing and payment of Enerpro invoices.  The prototype will be used by Enerpro and ioFusion to clearly define specific business logic requirements and associated application behaviour.  Hands on usage of a real interface will help us to efficiently cycle through a series of reviews and adjustments until we have addressed all the issues.  The prototype is not a throwaway, we will continue developing it into the complete web app.  Once the goals of the prototype have been achieved, the workload will be clear and we can define a reliable timeline and cost for the next phase.

## Deliverable

The static prototype to meet the following goals:
- Function as an interactive Web Application demonstrating the process Enerpro customers will use to view and pay their invoices.
- Through hands on usage it will be refined and used to articulate a specific deliverable to support the use cases involved in online customer billing and payments for Enerpro.
- Define Specific Data Elements
- Define Specific User Interface Elements
- Define Specific User Interface Behaviours
- Define Specific API for Azure backend
- Define Specific API for other SaaS providers (Stripe, â€¦)
- Define Security Risks Points and provide strategies to address them.

*ioFusion will utilize existing design elements from the new corporate site, but the prototype will not be graphically polished.  It will be developed quickly and that work will be focused on meeting the goals above efficiently.  Once finalized Outline Graphics can provide a polished design while ioFusion begins coding the final deliverable in the next phase of the project.

The prototype web app will support Open Web Standards and will run in web browsers on mobile, tablet, and desktop computers.  The same codebase can be used as a foundation to create iOS and Android applications at some point in the future if desired.

## Intellectual Property
Unless otherwise agreed, all prototypes, source code, documents, notes, diagrams and data are the property of Enerpro, and the Enerpro has control over commercialization and use. 

Source code for the project will be stored in the Github versioning system and will be released to Enerpro upon completion of the prototype.  During development we will utilize Github Issues to track ongoing work.  Those records will help to document development and will be released to Enerpro along with the source code.
